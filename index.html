<p>Welcome to STIX 2! Sharing threat intelligence just got easier.</p>

<p>This page is just a basic outline of the STIX 2.0 data model. If you&#39;re looking for an introduction or conceptual overview of STIX, see the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/stix-v2.0-part1-stix-core.html">full specification</a>. There&#39;s also the <a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/">documentation website</a> if you&#39;re looking for more examples and walkthroughs.</p>

<p>This documentation is divided into three major sections&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Core Objects</strong></p>

<p>Start here. This is the description for the main objects in STIX. It&#39;s divided into domain objects (things like malware instances, campaigns, and indicators) and relationship objects (relationship itself, and sighting). Bundle is used to carry around all of the other objects, and Marking Definition lets you apply handling statements to them.</p>

<p><strong>Vocabularies</strong></p>

<p>Many of the core objects contain properties that let you pick from a list of values. These vocabularies define those lists. In most cases, you don&#39;t actually have to use a value from the vocabulary, it&#39;s just recommended to improve compatibility.</p>

<p><strong>Common Types</strong></p>

<p>These common types are used by the core objects (and sometimes by other common types).</p>

<p><strong>Type Name</strong>: <code>attack-pattern</code></p>

<p>Attack Patterns are a type of TTP that describe ways that adversaries attempt to compromise targets. Attack Patterns are used to help categorize attacks, generalize specific attacks to the patterns that they follow, and provide detailed information about how attacks are performed. An example of an attack pattern is &quot;spear phishing&quot;: a common type of attack where an attacker sends a carefully crafted e-mail message to a party with the intent of getting them to click a link or open an attachment to deliver malware. Attack Patterns can also be more specific; spear phishing as practiced by a particular threat actor (e.g., they might generally say that the target won a contest) can also be an Attack Pattern.</p>

<p>The Attack Pattern SDO contains textual descriptions of the pattern along with references to externally-defined taxonomies of attacks such as CAPEC. Relationships from Attack Pattern can be used to relate it to what it targets (Vulnerabilities and Identities) and which tools and malware use it (Tool and Malware).</p>

<p><strong>Type Name</strong>: <code>campaign</code></p>

<p>A Campaign is a grouping of adversarial behaviors that describes a set of malicious activities or attacks (sometimes called waves) that occur over a period of time against a specific set of targets. Campaigns usually have well defined objectives and may be part of an Intrusion Set.</p>

<p>Campaigns are often attributed to an intrusion set and threat actors. The threat actors may reuse known infrastructure from the intrusion set or may set up new infrastructure specific for conducting that campaign.</p>

<p>Campaigns can be characterized by their objectives and the incidents they cause, people or resources they target, and the resources (infrastructure, intelligence, Malware, Tools, etc.) they use.</p>

<p>For example, a Campaign could be used to describe a crime syndicate&#39;s attack using a specific variant of malware and new C2 servers against the executives of ACME Bank during the summer of 2016 in order to gain secret information about an upcoming merger with another bank.</p>

<p><strong>Type Name</strong>: <code>course-of-action</code></p>

<p><b>Note: The Course of Action object in STIX 2.0 is a stub. It is included to support basic use cases (such as sharing prose courses of action) but does not support the ability to represent automated courses of action or contain properties to represent metadata about courses of action. Future STIX 2 releases will expand it to include these capabilities.</b></p>

<p>A Course of Action is an action taken either to prevent an attack or to respond to an attack that is in progress. It may describe technical, automatable responses (applying patches, reconfiguring firewalls) but can also describe higher level actions like employee training or policy changes. For example, a course of action to mitigate a vulnerability could describe applying the patch that fixes it.</p>

<p>The Course of Action SDO contains a textual description of the action; a reserved action property also serves as placeholder for future inclusion of machine automatable courses of action. Relationships from the Course of Action can be used to link it to the Vulnerabilities or behaviors (Tool, Malware, Attack Pattern) that it mitigates.</p>

<p><strong>Type Name</strong>: <code>indicator</code></p>

<p>Indicators contain a pattern that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity. For example, an Indicator may be used to represent a set of malicious domains and use the STIX Patterning Language (STIX™ Version 2.0. Part 5: STIX Patterning) to specify these domains.</p>

<p>The Indicator SDO contains a simple textual description, the Kill Chain Phases that it detects behavior in, a time window for when the Indicator is valid or useful, and a required pattern property to capture a structured detection pattern. Conforming STIX implementations <strong>MUST</strong> support the STIX Patterning Language as defined in STIX™ Version 2.0. Part 5: STIX Patterning. While each structured pattern language has different syntax and potentially different  semantics, in general an Indicator is considered to have &quot;matched&quot; (or been &quot;sighted&quot;) when the conditions specified in the structured pattern are satisfied in whatever context they are evaluated in.</p>

<p>Relationships from the Indicator can describe the malicious or suspicious behavior that it directly detects (Malware, Tool, and Attack Pattern) as well as the Campaigns, Intrusion Sets, and Threat Actors that it might indicate the presence of.</p>

<p><strong>Type Name</strong>: <code>intrusion-set</code></p>

<p>An Intrusion Set is a grouped set of adversarial behaviors and resources with common properties that is believed to be orchestrated by a single organization. An Intrusion Set may capture multiple Campaigns or other activities that are all tied together by shared attributes indicating a common known or unknown Threat Actor. New activity can be attributed to an Intrusion Set even if the Threat Actors behind the attack are not known. Threat Actors can move from supporting one Intrusion Set to supporting another, or they may support multiple Intrusion Sets.</p>

<p>Where a Campaign is a set of attacks over a period of time against a specific set of targets to achieve some objective, an Intrusion Set is the entire attack package and may be used over a very long period of time in multiple Campaigns to achieve potentially multiple purposes.</p>

<p>While sometimes an Intrusion Set is not active, or changes focus, it is usually difficult to know if it has truly disappeared or ended. Analysts may have varying level of fidelity on attributing an Intrusion Set back to Threat Actors and may be able to only attribute it back to a nation state or perhaps back to an organization within that nation state.</p>

<p><b>Note: The Malware object in STIX 2.0 is a stub. It is included to support basic use cases but is likely not useful for actual malware analysis or for including even simple malware instance data. Future versions of STIX 2 will expand it to include these capabilities.</b></p>

<p>Malware is a type of TTP that is also known as malicious code and malicious software, and refers to a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim&#39;s data, applications, or operating system (OS) or of otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim. Malware such as viruses and worms are usually designed to perform these nefarious functions in such a way that users are unaware of them, at least initially.</p>

<p>The Malware SDO characterizes, identifies, and categorizes malware samples and families via a text description property. This provides detailed information about how the malware works and what it does. Relationships from Malware can capture what the malware targets (Vulnerability and Identity) and link it to another Malware SDO that it is a variant of.</p>

<p>Observed Data conveys information that was observed on systems and networks using the Cyber Observable specification defined in parts 3 and 4 of this specification. For example, Observed Data can capture the observation of an IP address, a network connection, a file, or a registry key. Observed Data is not an intelligence assertion, it is simply information: this file was seen, without any context for what it means.</p>

<p>Observed Data captures both a single observation of a single entity (file, network connection) as well as the aggregation of multiple observations of an entity. When the <strong>number_observed</strong> property is 1 the Observed Data is of a single entity. When the <strong>number_observed</strong> property is greater than 1, the observed data consists of several instances of an entity collected over the time window specified by the <strong>first_observed</strong> and <strong>last_observed</strong> properties. When used to collect aggregate data, it is likely that some fields in the Cyber Observable Object (e.g., timestamp fields) will be omitted because they would differ for each of the individual observations.</p>

<p>Observed Data may be used by itself (without relationships) to convey raw data collected from network and host-based detection tools. A firewall could emit a single Observed Data instance containing a single Network Traffic object for each connection it sees. The firewall could also aggregate data and instead send out an Observed Data instance every ten minutes with an IP address and an appropriate number_observed value to indicate the number of times that IP address was observed in that window.</p>

<p>Observed Data may also be related to other SDOs to represent raw data that is relevant to those objects. The Sighting object, which captures the sighting of an Indicator, Malware, or other SDO, uses Observed Data to represent the raw information that led to the creation of the Sighting (e.g., what was actually seen that suggested that a particular instance of malware was active).</p>

Multiple objects not related to each other via Cyber Observable Relationships <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be contained within the same Observed Data instance. For example, a Network Traffic object and two IPv4 Address objects related via the src_ref and dst_ref properties can be contained in the same Observed Data because they are all related and used to characterize that single entity. Two unrelated IPv4 address objects that just happened to be observed at the same time, however, must be represented in separate Observed Data instances.</td>

<h3 id='relationships-8'>Relationships</h3>
<p>There are no relationships explicitly defined between the Observed Data object and other objects, other than those defined as common relationships. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target.</p>
<h2 id='relationship'>Relationship</h2>
<p>The Relationship object is used to link together two SDOs (objects other than Sighting, Relationship, Bundle, and Data Marking) in order to describe how they are related to each other. If SDOs are considered &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;vertices&quot; in the graph, the Relationship Objects (SROs) represent &quot;edges&quot;.</p>

<p>STIX defines many relationship types to link together SDOs. These relationships are contained in the &quot;Relationships&quot; table under each SDO definition. Relationship types defined in the specification <strong>SHOULD</strong> be used to ensure consistency. An example of a specification-defined relationship is that an indicator indicates a campaign. That relationship type is listed in the Relationships section of the Indicator SDO definition.</p>

<p>STIX also allows relationships from any SDO to any SDO that have not been defined in this specification. These relationships <strong>MAY</strong> use the <code>related-to</code> relationship type or <strong>MAY</strong> use a custom relationship type. As an example, a user might want to link malware directly to a tool. They can do so using <code>related-to</code> to say that the Malware is related to the Tool but not describe how, or they could use <code>delivered-by</code> (a custom name they determined) to indicate more detail.</p>

<p>Note that some relationships in STIX may seem like &quot;shortcuts&quot;. For example, an Indicator doesn&#39;t really detect a Campaign: it detects activity (Attack Patterns, Malware, etc.) that are often used by that campaign. While some analysts might want all of the source data and think that shortcuts are misleading, in many cases it&#39;s helpful to provide just the key points (shortcuts) and leave out the low-level details. In other cases, the low-level analysis may not be known or sharable, while the high-level analysis is. For these reasons, relationships that might appear to be &quot;shortcuts&quot; are not excluded from STIX.</p>

<p>Reports are collections of threat intelligence focused on one or more topics, such as a description of a threat actor, malware, or attack technique, including context and related details. They are used to group related threat intelligence together so that it can be published as a comprehensive cyber threat story.</p>

<p>The Report SDO contains a list of references to SDOs and SROs (the CTI objects included in the report) along with a textual description and the name of the report.</p>

<p>For example, a threat report produced by ACME Defense Corp. discussing the Glass Gazelle campaign should be represented using Report. The Report itself would contain the narrative of the report while the Campaign SDO and any related SDOs (e.g., Indicators for the Campaign, Malware it uses, and the associated Relationships) would be referenced in the report contents.</p>

<p>A Sighting denotes the belief that something in CTI (e.g., an indicator, malware, tool, threat actor, etc.) was seen. Sightings are used to track who and what are being targeted, how attacks are carried out, and to track trends in attack behavior.</p>

<p>The Sighting relationship object is a special type of SRO; it is a relationship that contains extra properties not present on the generic Relationship object. These extra properties are included to represent data specific to sighting relationships (e.g., count, representing how many times something was seen), but for other purposes a Sighting can be thought of as a Relationship with a name of &quot;sighting-of&quot;. Sighting is captured as a relationship because you cannot have a sighting unless you have something that has been sighted. Sighting does not make sense without the relationship to what was sighted.</p>

<p>Sighting relationships relate three aspects of the sighting:
* What was sighted, such as the Indicator, Malware, Campaign, or other SDO (<strong>sighting_of_ref</strong>)
* Who sighted it and/or where it was sighted, represented as an Identity (<strong>where_sighted_refs</strong>) and
* What was actually seen on systems and networks, represented as Observed Data (<strong>observed_data_refs</strong>)</p>

<p>What was sighted is required; a sighting does not make sense unless you say what you saw. Who sighted it, where it was sighted, and what was actually seen are optional. In many cases it is not necessary to provide that level of detail in order to provide value.</p>

<p>Sightings are used whenever any SDO has been &quot;seen&quot;. In some cases, the object creator wishes to convey very little information about the sighting; the details might be sensitive, but the fact that they saw a malware instance or threat actor could still be very useful. In other cases, providing the details may be helpful or even necessary; saying exactly which of the 1000 IP addresses in an indicator were sighted is helpful when tracking which of those IPs is still malicious.</p>

<p>Sighting is distinct from Observed Data in that Sighting is an intelligence assertion (&quot;I saw this threat actor&quot;) while Observed Data is simply information (&quot;I saw this file&quot;). When you combine them by including the linked Observed Data (<strong>observed_data_refs</strong>) from a Sighting, you can say &quot;I saw this file, and that makes me think I saw this threat actor&quot;. Although confidence is currently reserved, notionally confidence would be added to Sighting (the intelligence relationship) but not to Observed Data (the raw information).</p>

<p>Threat Actors are actual individuals, groups, or organizations believed to be operating with malicious intent. A Threat Actor is not an Intrusion Set but may support or be affiliated with various Intrusion Sets, groups, or organizations over time.</p>

<p>Threat Actors leverage their resources, and possibly the resources of an Intrusion Set, to conduct attacks and run Campaigns against targets.</p>

<p>Threat Actors can be characterized by their motives, capabilities, goals, sophistication level, past activities, resources they have access to, and their role in the organization.</p>

Personal motivation, which is independent of the organization’s goals, describes what impels an individual to carry out an attack. Personal motivation may align with the organization’s motivation—as is common with activists—but more often it supports personal goals. For example, an individual analyst may join a Data Miner corporation because his or her skills may align with the corporation’s objectives. But the analyst most likely performs his or her daily work toward those objectives for personal reward in the form of a paycheck. The motivation of personal reward may be even stronger for Threat Actors who commit illegal acts, as it is more difficult for someone to cross that line purely for altruistic reasons. This is an open vocabulary and values <strong>SHOULD</strong> come from the <a href="#attack-motivation">attack-motivation-ov</a> vocabulary.</td>

<p>Tools are legitimate software that can be used by threat actors to perform attacks. Knowing how and when threat actors use such tools can be important for understanding how campaigns are executed. Unlike malware, these tools or software packages are often found on a system and have legitimate purposes for power users, system administrators, network administrators, or even normal users. Remote access tools (e.g., RDP) and network scanning tools (e.g., Nmap) are examples of Tools that may be used by a Threat Actor during an attack.</p>

<p>The Tool SDO characterizes the properties of these software tools and can be used as a basis for making an assertion about how a Threat Actor uses them during an attack. It contains properties to name and describe the tool, a list of Kill Chain Phases the tool can be used to carry out, and the version of the tool.</p>

<p>This SDO <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used to characterize malware. Further, Tool <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used to characterise tools used as part of a course of action in response to an attack. Tools used during response activities can be included directly as part of a Course of Action SDO.</p>

<p>A Vulnerability is &quot;a mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network&quot; [CVE]. For example, if a piece of malware exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a Vulnerability object that references CVE-2015-12345.</p>

<p>The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not yet have an external definition. Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to Vulnerability objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted and exploited as part of malicious cyber activity. As such, Vulnerability objects can be used as a linkage to the asset management and compliance process.</p>

<p>The marking-definition object represents a specific marking. Data markings typically represent handling or sharing requirements for data, and are applied in the <strong>object_marking_refs</strong> and granular_markings properties on STIX Objects, which reference a list of IDs for <code>marking-definition</code> objects.</p>

<p>Two marking definition types are defined in this specification: TLP, to capture TLP markings, and Statement, to capture text marking statements. In addition, it is expected that the FIRST Information Exchange Policy (IEP) will be included in a future version once a machine-usable specification for it has been defined.</p>

<p>Unlike STIX Objects, Marking Definition objects cannot be versioned because it would allow for indirect changes to the markings on a STIX Object. For example, if a Statement marking is changed from &quot;Reuse Allowed&quot; to &quot;Reuse Prohibited&quot;, all STIX Objects marked with that Statement marking would effectively have an updated marking without being updated themselves. Instead, a new Statement marking with the new text should be created and the marked objects updated to point to the new marking.</p>

<p>The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON object type [RFC7159] when representing <code>marking-definition</code>.</p>

<p>The Statement marking type defines the representation of a textual marking statement (e.g., copyright, terms of use, etc.) in a definition. The value of the <strong>definition_type</strong> property <strong>MUST</strong> be <code>statement</code> when using this marking type. Statement markings are generally not machine-readable and this specification does not define any behavior or actions based on their values.</p>

<p>Content may be marked with multiple Statement marking types that do not override each other. In other words, the same content can be marked both with a statement saying &quot;Copyright 2016&quot; and a statement saying &quot;Terms of use are ...&quot; and both statements apply.</p>

<p>The TLP marking type defines how you would represent a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) marking in a definition property. The value of the <strong>definition_type</strong> property <strong>MUST</strong> be <code>tlp</code> when using this marking type.</p>

<p>Because there are only four TLP levels, STIX has pre-defined the STIX objects used to represent them. To use them, reference them by ID directly (see the objects to the right). You could also include the full objects if you want.</p>
<h3 id='granular-marking'>Granular Marking</h3>
<p>The <code>granular-marking</code> type defines how the <code>marking-definition</code> object referenced by the <strong>marking_ref</strong> property applies to a set of content identified by the list of selectors in the selectors property.</p>

<h4 id='selector-syntax'>Selector Syntax</h4>
<p>Selectors contained in the selectors list are strings that consist of multiple components that <strong>MUST</strong> be separated by the . character. Each component <strong>MUST</strong> be one of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A property name, e.g., description, or;</li>
<li>A zero-based list index, specified as a non-negative integer in square brackets, e.g., [4]</li>
</ul>

<p>Selectors denote path traversals: the root of each selector is the STIX Object that the <strong>granular_markings</strong> property appears in. Starting from that root, for each component in the selector, properties and list items are traversed. When the complete list has been traversed, the value of the content is considered selected.</p>

<p>Selectors <strong>MUST</strong> refer to properties or list items that are actually present on the marked object.</p>

<p>Considering the example to the right, the following selectors are valid:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>description</code> selects the <strong>description</strong> property (&quot;The (1) TLS...&quot;).</li>
<li><code>external_references.[0].source_name</code> selects the <strong>source_name</strong> property of the first value of the <strong>external_references</strong> list (&quot;cve&quot;).</li>
<li><code>labels.[0]</code> selects the first item contained within the <strong>labels</strong> list (&quot;heartbleed&quot;).</li>
<li><code>labels</code> selects the list contained in the <strong>labels</strong> property. Due to the recursive nature of the selector, that includes all items in the list ([&quot;heartbleed&quot;, &quot;has-logo&quot;]).</li>
<li><code>external_references</code> selects the list contained in the <strong>external_references</strong> property. Due to the recursive nature of the selector, that includes all list items and all properties of those list items.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, still looking at the same example, the following selectors are not valid:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pattern</code> and <code>external_references.[3]</code> are invalid selectors because they refer to content not present in that object.</li>
<li><code>description.[0]</code> is an invalid selector because the <strong>description</strong> property is a string and not a list.</li>
<li><code>labels.name</code> is an invalid selector because <strong>labels</strong> property is a list and not an object.</li>
</ul>

<p>This syntax is inspired by JSONPath and is in fact a strict subset of allowable JSONPath expressions (with the exception that the &#39;$&#39; to indicate the root is implicit). Care should be taken when passing selectors to JSONPath evaluators to ensure that the root of the query is the individual STIX Object. It is expected, however, that selectors can be easily evaluated in programming languages that implement list and key/value mapping types (dictionaries, hashmaps, etc.) without resorting to an external library.</p>

<p>The attack motivation vocabulary is currently used in the following SDOs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intrusion Set</li>
<li>Threat Actor</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing a Threat Actor or Intrusion Set&#39;s motivation may allow an analyst or defender to better understand likely targets and behaviors.</p>

<p>Motivation shapes the intensity and the persistence of an attack. Threat Actors and Intrusion Sets usually act in a manner that reflects their underlying emotion or situation, and this informs defenders of the manner of attack. For example, a spy motivated by nationalism (ideology) likely has the patience to achieve long-term goals and work quietly for years, whereas a cyber-vandal out for notoriety can create an intense and attention-grabbing attack but may quickly lose interest and move on. Understanding these differences allows defenders to implement controls tailored to each type of attack for greatest efficiency.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>accidental</strong></td>
<td>A non-hostile actor whose benevolent or harmless intent inadvertently causes harm. For example, a well-meaning and dedicated employee who through distraction or poor training unintentionally causes harm to his or her organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>coercion</strong></td>
<td>Being forced to act on someone else&#39;s behalf. Adversaries who are motivated by coercion are often forced through intimidation or blackmail to act illegally for someone else’s benefit. Unlike the other motivations, a coerced person does not act for personal gain, but out of fear of incurring a loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>dominance</strong></td>
<td>A desire to assert superiority over someone or something else. Adversaries who are seeking dominance over a target are focused on using their power to force their target into submission or irrelevance. Dominance may be found with ideology in some state-sponsored attacks and with notoriety in some cyber vandalism based attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ideology</strong></td>
<td>A passion to express a set of ideas, beliefs, and values that may shape and drive harmful and illegal acts. Adversaries who act for ideological reasons (e.g., political, religious, human rights, environmental, desire to cause chaos/anarchy, etc.) are not usually motivated primarily by the desire for profit; they are acting on their own sense of morality, justice, or political loyalty. For example, an activist group may sabotage a company’s equipment because they believe the company is harming the environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>notoriety</strong></td>
<td>Seeking prestige or to become well known through some activity. Adversaries motivated by notoriety are often seeking either personal validation or respect within a community and staying covert is not a priority. In fact one of the main goals is to garner the respect of their target audience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>organizational-gain</strong></td>
<td>Seeking advantage over a competing organization, including a military organization. Adversaries motivated by increased profit or other gains through an unfairly obtained competitive advantage are often seeking theft of intellectual property, business processes, or supply chain agreements and thus accelerating their position in a market or capability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>personal-gain</strong></td>
<td>The desire to improve one’s own financial status. Adversaries motivated by a selfish desire for personal gain are often out for gains that come from financial fraud, hacking for hire, or intellectual property theft. While a Threat Actor or Intrusion Set may be seeking personal gain this does not mean they are acting alone. Individuals can band together solely to maximize their own personal profits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>personal-satisfaction</strong></td>
<td>A desire to satisfy a strictly personal goal, including curiosity, thrill-seeking, amusement, etc. Threat Actors or Intrusion Set driven by personal satisfaction may incidentally receive some other gain from their actions, such as a profit, but their primary motivation is to gratify a personal, emotional need. Individuals can band together with others toward a mutual, but not necessarily organizational, objective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>revenge</strong></td>
<td>A desire to avenge perceived wrongs through harmful actions such as sabotage, violence, theft, fraud, or embarrassing certain individuals or the organization. A disgruntled Threat Actor or Intrusion Set seeking revenge can include current or former employees, who may have extensive knowledge to leverage when conducting attacks. Individuals can band together with others if the individual believes that doing so will enable them to cause more harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>unpredictable</strong></td>
<td>Acting without identifiable reason or purpose and creating unpredictable events. Unpredictable is not a miscellaneous or default category. Unpredictable means a truly random and likely bizarre event, which seems to have no logical purpose to the victims.</td>

<p>The list type defines a sequence of values ordered based on how they appear in the list. The phrasing “list of type &lt;type&gt;” is used to indicate that all values within the list <strong>MUST</strong> conform to the specified type. For instance, list of type integer means that all values of the list must be of the integer type. This specification does not specify the maximum number of allowed values in a list, however every instance of a list <strong>MUST</strong> have at least one value. Specific STIX object properties may define more restrictive upper and/or lower bounds for the length of the list.</p>

<p>Empty lists are prohibited in STIX and <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used as a substitute for omitting the property if it is optional. If the property is required, the list <strong>MUST</strong> be present and <strong>MUST</strong> have at least one value.</p>

<p>The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON array type, which is an ordered list of zero or more values.</p>

<p>The <code>open-vocab</code> type is represented as a string. For properties that use this type there will be a list of suggested values, known as the suggested vocabulary, that is identified in the definition for that property. The suggested vocabularies are defined in section 6. The value of the property <strong>SHOULD</strong> be chosen from the suggested vocabulary but <strong>MAY</strong> be any other string value. Values that are not from the suggested vocabulary <strong>SHOULD</strong> be all lowercase (where lowercase is defined by the locality conventions) and <strong>SHOULD</strong> use hyphens instead of spaces or underscores as word separators.</p>

<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>type</strong> (required)</td>
<td><a href="#string">string</a></td>
<td>The <strong>type</strong> property identifies the type of STIX Object. The value of the type property <strong>MUST</strong> be the name of one of the types of STIX Object defined in sections 2 and 3 of STIX™ Version 2.0. Part 2: STIX Objects (e.g., indicator) or the name of a custom object as defined by section 7.2.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>id</strong> (required)</td>
<td><a href="#identifier">identifier</a></td>
<td>The <strong>id</strong> property universally and uniquely identifies this object. All objects with the same id are considered different versions of the same object. Because the object type is part of the identifier, it is invalid for objects of different types to share the same id.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>created_by_ref</strong> (optional)</td>
<td><a href="#identifier">identifier</a></td>
<td>The <strong>created_by_ref</strong> property specifies the ID of the Identity object that describes the entity that created this object. If this attribute is omitted, the source of this information is undefined. This may be used by object creators who wish to remain anonymous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>created</strong> (required)</td>
<td><a href="#timestamp">timestamp</a></td>
<td>The <strong>created</strong> property represents the time at which the first version of this object was created. The object creator can use the time it deems most appropriate as the time the object was created. The <strong>created</strong> property <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be changed when creating a new version of the object. The created timestamp <strong>MUST</strong> be precise to the nearest millisecond (exactly three digits after the decimal place in seconds). See section 3.4 for further definition of versioning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>modified</strong> (required)</td>
<td><a href="#timestamp">timestamp</a></td>
<td>The <strong>modified</strong> property represents the time that this particular version of the object was created. The object creator can use the time it deems most appropriate as the time this version of the object was modified. The value of the modified property for a given object version <strong>MUST</strong> be later than or equal to the value of the created property. Object creators <strong>MUST</strong> set the modified property when creating a new version of an object. The modified timestamp <strong>MUST</strong> be precise to the nearest millisecond (exactly three digits after the decimal place in seconds). See section 3.4 for further definition of versioning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>revoked</strong> (optional)</td>
<td><a href="#boolean">boolean</a></td>
<td>The <strong>revoked</strong> property indicates whether the object has been revoked. Revoked objects are no longer considered valid by the object creator. Revoking an object is permanent; future versions of the object with this id <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be created. The default value of this property is <code>false</code>. See section 3.4 for further definition of versioning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>labels</strong> (optional)</td>
<td><a href="#list">list</a> of type <a href="#string">string</a></td>
<td>The <strong>labels</strong> property specifies a set of classifications. Each STIX Object can define a suggested vocabulary for the labels property. For example, the Indicator object, as defined in section 2.5 of STIX™ Version 2.0. Part 2: STIX Objects, uses the Indicator Label vocabulary as defined in section 6.5. In some cases (generally, when a suggested vocabulary is defined) the labels property is then required for that specific SDO. If a vocabulary is defined, items in this list <strong>SHOULD</strong> come from the vocabulary. Additional labels <strong>MAY</strong> be added beyond what is in the suggested vocabulary.</td>
